# Invoice Windows Forms Application

Windows Forms (WinForms) is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It is a .NET wrapper over Windows user interface libraries, such as User32 and GDI+. It also offers controls and other functionality that is unique to Windows Forms.

Windows Forms also provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop applications based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. It enables drag-and-drop of visual controls and other similar functionality that make it easy to build desktop applications.

## Windows Forms Designer

For more information about the designer, please see the [Windows Forms Designer Documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/winforms-designer.md).

To learn about project priorities as well as status and ship dates see the [Windows Forms Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/roadmap.md).

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is another UI framework used to build Windows desktop applications which is supported on .NET Core. WPF and Windows Forms applications run only on Windows operating systems. They are part of the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop SDK. You are recommended to use Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1 to use WPF and Windows Forms with .NET Core.
